# Qt Facial Detection
A basic Qt widget for previewing camera feed and integrated with YuNet Neural network model from OpenCV. 

# Next Steps
* Visualize face-boundary through Shaders as opposed to CPU.
* implement real-time facial-blur
* It might be beneficial to sub-classing the `cv::FaceDetectorYN` as opposed to making it a member variable
